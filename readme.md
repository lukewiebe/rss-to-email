# RSS to Email

Hello! This is my first ever Python project. It's mostly an excuse to learn Python, but it's also something I want to use.

This will become an automated daily digest that will email(?) me new articles from my RSS feeds.

## Current State

After turning to the [Universal Feed Parser](https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) in desperation (turns out XPath queries are complicated), things are chugging along. I've got some basic date checking logic built with some test data.
