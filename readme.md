# RSS to Email

Hello! This is my first ever Python project. It's mostly an excuse to learn Python, but it's also something I want to use.

This will become an automated daily digest that will email(?) me new articles from my RSS feeds.

## Current State

After turning to the [Universal Feed Parser](https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) in desperation (turns out XPath queries are complicated), things are chugging along. I've got some basic date checking logic built with test data generated by `test_feed_response.py`.

There's a couple things left to do.

1. Add some error handling to `script.py`. Ideally it should have special cases for feeds not existing or returning incorrect data.

2. I originally wanted this script to email me every day, but that would require me to run a separate service capable of sending emails. Setting email up from scratch is complicated, and since I'm just starting out I'd prefer to keep things simple. For that reason, instead of using email I'll be running this script locally on my Mac and using a Things URL to add new RSS entries to my Things inbox.
